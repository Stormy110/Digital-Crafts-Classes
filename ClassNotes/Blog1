# Today we began to learn about variables, data types and conditional/comparisons

## Variables are ways to store values
## name = "ian"      or      age = 29

## Data types are the type of data used
## examples include strings(groups of characters wrapped in quotation marks)
## integers (which are whole numbers - negative or positive)
## floats (which are numbers with decimals)
## booleans - true or false
## We also learned about truthy and falsy statements

## we used compartive operators to compare values, these can compare numbers/strings/variables etc..
## for example: 1 >= 5,    "Ian" == "Bob",    name != age

## we learned how to use conditional statements
## these check to see IF something is true/false and returns a value or executes a code block
