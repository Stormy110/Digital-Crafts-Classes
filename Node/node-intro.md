## Runtime Environment - Is the 'space' that a piece of software is executed. It can refer everything including the hardware, but it can also be talking about the software that is executing another software such as node.


## What is Node?
### Node is a javascript runtime environment created to be used on a server, but has been since adpted to be used almost on any computer or device.
It was created by Ryan Dahl, who has since left node and created another Js runtime called deno.The main function of node is to allow javascript to be used in places that formally required require another language, such as a server. This enables a developer to only know one language to do front-end and backend development.
